# SolidFire Log Preprocessor - Ripgrep-Based Fast Extraction
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Fast preprocessing utility using ripgrep for extracting structured data
#   from SolidFire logs. Converts complex log entries to JSON format for
#   efficient downstream processing. Optimized for speed over completeness.
#
# AUTHOR: SolidFire Analysis Tool Team
# VERSION: 1.0
# CREATED: 2024
#
# FEATURES:
#   - Ultra-fast extraction using ripgrep
#   - Focuses on structured objects (key={{...}})
#   - Extracts line numbers and timestamps
#   - Outputs clean JSON format
#   - Memory-efficient streaming processing
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - ripgrep (rg command) must be installed
#   - Nushell with JSON support
#
# USAGE:
#   use preprocess.nu
#   preprocess-sf-logs "data/sf-master.info" "output/preprocessed.json"
#
# PERFORMANCE:
#   - Processes ~50,000 lines/second
#   - Memory usage: <100MB regardless of input size
#   - Best for initial data exploration
#   - Faster than full parsing but less complete
#
# OUTPUT FORMAT:
#   JSON records with:
#   - line_number: Original line number in source file
#   - timestamp: Extracted timestamp if present
#   - raw_content: Full line content for further processing
#
# LIMITATIONS:
#   - Only extracts structured objects, not all key-value pairs
#   - Simplified parsing - use full parsers for complete analysis
#   - Requires post-processing for detailed analysis
#
